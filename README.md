If you are here, it's probably because you were linked from an app in Apple's App Store and and wish to report an issue with the app. I do apologize for the inconvenience. 

Please email me at <joe.vargas.iosdev@gmail.com> explaining the issue you are experiencing, your iPhone model and iOS version installed. I should respond within 12-24 hours.
